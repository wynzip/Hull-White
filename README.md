# Hull-White

Hello, this is the project 7 for the Financial Engineering course at Politecnico di Milano. It was developed by Sara Cupini, Francesco Panichi and Davide Pagani.

The project consists of two main exercises. Firstly, the pricing of a certain certificate, given the termsheet of the issue and of an hedging swap. 

Secondly, the pricing of a Bermudan yearly Payer Swaption, considering a 1-factor Hull-White model and using a trinomial tree to model the dynamics
of the underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean reversing stochastic process. Then, a lower bound for the swaption price is found using the Jamshidian formula.

The file "runAssignment7_group11.m"" is the main file to run the project. Regarding the second exercise, the most relevant files are "bermudan_tree.m" 
and "swaptionPriceJamshidian.m".
